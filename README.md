# jsoup-sel

A popular option for testing web applications is Selenium, which uses a variety of tools such as Java and JavaScript to automate the tests. 
However, as the applications become more complex, a single page application (SPA) will be harder to manage with Selenium. Jsoup is a 
library that can be used in conjunction with Selenium to take care of some of the issues related to SPAs and dynamic web apps. It has a wrapper around Selenium that 
simplifies the process of running the test and allows you to use dynamic locators instead of page objects.
